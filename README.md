# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
Google's Flutter UI toolkit that allows you to build mobile apps with a single codebase.  This streamlined approach is what appeals to me should I find myself
in an app developement setting.

{Provide a description of your app.  Describe how to use the app.}
The app is very simple.  It opens quickly to a full screen layout of seven xylophone keys, also labeled for solfege practice.  When you tap anywhere on
the key, it plays the corresponding note.

{Describe your purpose for creating this app.}
The app idea was inspired by my kids.  They love playing with toy xylophones.  So, I built a magic xylophone app to play with my kids.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the app}
I used Android Studio for an editor, Dart as the program language and the Flutter development libraries to build the app.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
Dart is an object-oriented language developed by Google for developing fast apps on any platform (web, mobile, and desktop).  It provides the foundation
that Flutter is built and supports many other developing tasks like formatting, analyzing, and testing code.  It is also type safe and offers sound null
safety.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I'd like for the app to play a song after a random number of keys are played.
* I'd like to add optional instruments for different sounds.
* I'd like a more advanced option with more notes than just seven.
