# Overview

Google's Flutter UI toolkit that allows you to build mobile apps with a single codebase.  This streamlined approach is what appeals to me should I find myself
in an app developement setting.

The app is very simple.  It opens quickly to a full screen layout of seven xylophone keys, also labeled for solfege practice.  When you tap anywhere on
the key, it plays the corresponding note.

The app idea was inspired by my kids.  They love playing with toy xylophones.  So, I built a magic xylophone app to play with my kids.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio for an editor, Dart as the program language and the Flutter development libraries to build the app.

Dart is an object-oriented language developed by Google for developing fast apps on any platform (web, mobile, and desktop).  It provides the foundation
that Flutter is built and supports many other developing tasks like formatting, analyzing, and testing code.  It is also type safe and offers sound null
safety.

# Future Work

* I'd like for the app to play a song after a random number of keys are played.
* I'd like to add optional instruments for different sounds.
* I'd like a more advanced option with more notes than just seven.
